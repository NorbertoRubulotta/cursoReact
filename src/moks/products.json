    "title": "Macallan 1990 Fine & Rare + GB 70cl",
    "description": "The Macallan Fine and Rare collection bottles were released with the motivation of recreating the very best vintages which Macallan had to offer. The collection came to the market in 2002 with the goal of showcasing the sheer range of vintage-statement whiskies that Macallan has produced and allowing the drinker or owner to take a journey through history Containing over 50 vintages that date all the way back to 1926. The idea was relatively simple to introduce a new vintage each year, continuing to build a vintage range unsurpassed in the industry. This unique bottle was distilled in December 1990 when it reached an age of 22 years back in 2013. It came from a single cask #24706 which contained 481 bottles.",
